# Rig configuration

This directory should contain files that configure the rigs.

   - `<myhostname>.sh` sets up Environment variables used both to set up the rig at `myhostname`, and to run other scripts on `myhostname`

   - `<myhostname>.overclock.json` is used to configure the script that sets overclock settings on `myhostname`
   
It's empty apart from some sample files
